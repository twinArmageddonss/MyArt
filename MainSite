  Welcome to my Website!

   This website is for Boba Drops, which is for my school's Hack Club.

  I mainly draw my Original Characters, or fanart of characters I like!

  More information about me:
I am an 18-year-old high school student (class of 2025!). I've been drawing since I was around 5 years old, and I'm currently taking art classes in school. I'm trying to get into Penn State Harrisburg for biotechnology! I'm very new to coding, but I'm excited to learn more about it!
